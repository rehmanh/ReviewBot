1 It 's that painful .
2 The movie 's downfall is to substitute plot for personality .
3 The film is darkly atmospheric , with Herrmann quietly suggesting the sadness and obsession beneath Hearst 's forced avuncular chortles .

4 It 's an experience in understanding a unique culture that is presented with universal appeal .
4 A witty , whimsical feature debut .
5 Exhilarating , funny and fun .
2 As an entertainment destination for the general public , Kung Pow sets a new benchmark for lameness .
4 Downbeat , period-perfect biopic hammers home a heavy-handed moralistic message .
2 None of this so-called satire has any sting to it , as if Woody is afraid of biting the hand that has finally , to some extent , warmed up to him .
3 The Santa Clause 3 is a barely adequate babysitter for older kids , but I 've got to give it thumbs down .
2 Sometimes there are very , very good reasons for certain movies to be sealed in a jar and left on a remote shelf indefinitely .
4 It makes you believe the cast and crew thoroughly enjoyed themselves and believed in their small-budget film .
2 The idea is more interesting than the screenplay , which lags badly in the middle and lurches between not-very-funny comedy , unconvincing dramatics and some last-minute action strongly reminiscent of Run Lola Run .
2 Woefully pretentious .
2 Lacks the visual flair and bouncing bravado that characterizes better hip-hop clips and is content to recycle images and characters that were already tired 11 years ago .
4 Makes one thing abundantly clear .
4 A flick about our infantilized culture that is n't entirely infantile .
2 Still , it just sits there like a side dish no one ordered .
2 We can tell what it is supposed to be , but ca n't really call it a work of art .
1 A ragbag of cliches .
1 Diaz wears out her welcome in her most charmless performance
4 The script manages the rare trick of seeming at once both refreshingly different and reassuringly familiar .
4 It 's a clear-eyed portrait of an intensely lived time , filled with nervous energy , moral ambiguity and great uncertainties .
5 an admirable , sometimes exceptional film
2 A mediocre exercise in target demographics , unaware that it 's the butt of its own joke .
5 Well cast and well directed - a powerful drama with enough sardonic wit to keep it from being maudlin .
3 This big screen caper has a good bark , far from being a bow-wow .
3 The doofus-on - the-loose banter of Welcome to Collinwood has a cocky , after-hours loopiness to it .
1 The comedy is nonexistent .
1 An unremittingly ugly movie to look at , listen to , and think about , it is quite possibly the sturdiest example yet of why the DV revolution has cheapened the artistry of making a film .
3 Meant for Star Wars fans .
2 The film , like Jimmy 's routines , could use a few good laughs .
5 Highly watchable stuff .
3 Dense and enigmatic ... elusive ... stagy and stilted
3 If the movie were all comedy , it might work better .
4 May lack the pungent bite of its title , but it 's an enjoyable trifle nonetheless .
1 It 's as sorry a mess as its director 's diabolical debut , Mad Cows .
2 While this film has an ` A ' list cast and some strong supporting players , the tale -- like its central figure , Vivi -- is just a little bit hard to love .
2 As for children , they wo n't enjoy the movie at all .
5 It 's no lie -- Big Fat Liar is a real charmer .
5 A witty , low-key romantic comedy .
3 Streamlined to a tight , brisk 85-minute screwball thriller , `` Big Trouble '' is funny , harmless and as substantial as a tub of popcorn with extra butter .
2 Death might be a release .
2 Simplistic , silly and tedious .
