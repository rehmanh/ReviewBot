### About

A sentiment-analysis app that uses movie reviews of films entered by users to rate reviews. The inspiration for this project came from [this](https://www.kaggle.com/c/sentiment-analysis-on-movie-reviews) competition on Kaggle. Users can enter reviews of whatever movies they'd like to review and the app tells them how they rank the movie based on the words and emotions in their reviews. 

This project was mainly an experiment with developing for Android. 

### Caveats

- The bot cannot differentiate between colloqial and written English, so complex strings or slang is not handled accurately. 
- Only tested up to Android version 7.1.
